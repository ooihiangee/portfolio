## [Project 1: A Statistical Analysis of Labour Force Participation Rate in Malaysia for the Last Four Decades](https://github.com/ooihiangee/Data-Science-Projects/tree/main/Economic%20Modelling%20of%20MYR%20to%20USD%20Exchange%20Rates%20and%20Key%20Macroeconomic%20Factors)

The study will be focus on analysing the trend of labour force participation rate (LFPR) in Malaysia from the year 1982 to 2021 by gender, age group, educational attainments and marital status. The data is originated from Department of Statistics Malaysia. Time series analysis and Simple Exponential Smoothing (SES) Method was performed to forecast the LFPR for the upcoming few years. Besides, study was conducted on how different socio-demographic factors of labour force impact the overall LFPR across states and federal territories from the year 2016 to 2021 using panel data analysis. 

The time series plot showed that LFPR hovered between 62% and 68% for the past 40 years and it hit the peak at 68.7% in 2019. At all time, male LFPR was significantly higher than female LFPR. It was also discovered that the demographic factors such as marital status and education level do possess different relationship with LFPR by gender. In summary, the outcomes of this study may serve as a reference for the policymakers to come up with essential decisions regarding education, training and creation of jobs for the labour market.


## [Project 2: Econometric Modelling of MYR/USD Exchange Rates and Key Macroeconomic Data](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13YJUUWhTPRoTUwjMGC2OA9Hx_1n4LtYQ?usp=sharing)

Stability in a countryâ€™s currency exchange rates is extremely crucial as fluctuations in the exchange rates significantly impact the international trade, investment, debt, and a country's overall economic health. The exchanges rates are always linked to a variety of internal and external factors, among them are what we called as macroeconomic factors which include gross export values, Industrial Production Index (IPI) and so on. This research seeks to explore the underlying relationship between these macroeconomic variables and the currency exchange rate of Malaysian Ringgits (MYR) vs US Dollars (USD) by leveraging latest available data up to the year of 2023. The motivation behind this research lies in the recognition that a thorough understanding of the relationships between macroeconomic variables and currency exchange rates can be beneficial for informed policymaking and budgeting. In view of Malaysia as a developing country where its economy is evolving by leap and bounds at the present, a comprehensive analysis becomes necessary.

## [Entrepreneurial Competency Study](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/1515d8b6-1efb-417a-ab6a-50bffe05a2ba/ReportSection?experience=power-bi)
The dataset consists of responses collected from the university students via entrepreneurial competency study survey. It collects respondents' demographics, existence of several personality traits such as resilience, competitiveness and etc weighted on a scale of 1 to 5, reasons behind lack of interest in entrepreneurship as well as whether the student is likely to become an entrepreneur or not.

* The respondents' ages range from 17 to 26 years old and most of them are aged 20 at a count of 79. The number of males undertake number of females at all ages except 23 and 25. At age of 23, there is a male and a female respondent, while at age of 25, there is only 1 female respondent.
* From the chart, entrepreneurs achieve higher average scores for all attributes namely Strong Need to Achieve, Self-Reliance, Desire to Take Initiatives, Competitiveness, Self-Confidence, Good Physical Health, and Perseverance compared to non-entrepreneurs. Least discrepancies exhibit in the average score of Competitiveness between both groups.
* The top reason for lack of interest in entrepreneurship is solely no interest. A total of 63 respondents desire to work in the corporate sector, for the government, pursue research or something else instead of taking part in entrepreneurship activities. It is followed by lack of knowledge (45) and academic pressure (36). Another significant and common reason is not able to take the financial risk at a count of 33.
* 85.71% of the entrepreneurs involved in the study were influenced. On the other hand, it also shows that a considerable number of individuals influenced before do not pursue entrepreneurship which occupy for 62.5% of the non-entrepreneurs. Thus, we are hard to conclude that there is a strong association between early influence and an individual's likelihood of embarking on the entrepreneurial journey.
